# Exploring U.S Births

In this project, we want to explore data on births in the United States. The dataset was compiled by FiveThirtyEight and can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/births/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv).

The dataset contains the following columns:
* `year` - Year (1994 to 2003)
* `month` - Month (1 to 12)
* `day_of_month` - Day number of the month (1 to 31)
* `day_of_week` - Day of the week (1 to 7)
* `births` - Number of births on a specific date

**Objectives**: The objectives of this project is to learn about the Jupyer Notebook environment, to work with a CSV dataset and to do exploratory research on the dataset.
